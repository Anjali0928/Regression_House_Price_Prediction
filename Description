What is RMSE?
RMSE tells us how far our model’s predictions are from the actual values, on average.
It’s the square root of the average squared errors.
The smaller the RMSE, the better the model fits the data.
Formula
RMSE=1n∑i=1n(yi−y^i)2−−−−−−−−−−−−√ 

Where:

yi  = actual value
y^i  = predicted value
n  = number of data points
Why Square the Errors?
Errors can be positive or negative → squaring makes them all positive.
Squaring also penalizes large errors more heavily (big mistakes hurt RMSE more).
Why Take the Square Root?
Without the root, we get Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is in squared units (not intuitive).
Taking the square root brings it back to the same units as the target variable.
Example
Suppose actual house prices = [200, 220, 250]

Predicted = [210, 215, 240]

Errors = [-10, +5, +10]

Squared Errors = [100, 25, 100]

MSE = (100 + 25 + 100) / 3 = 75

RMSE = √75 ≈ 8.66

This means: on average, predictions are off by ~9 units (in same scale as house prices).

In short:

RMSE = average error size between predictions and actual values.
Always in the same unit as the target (e.g., dollars, cm, etc.).
Smaller RMSE = better predictions.
